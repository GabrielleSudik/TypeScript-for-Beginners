DO: check that you've been writing TS and not JS files
you might have gotten confused with another course.

23 plus: typescript fundmentals

Why use Typescript? What problems does it solve?

JS has been around since like 1995. It's good and getting better. But...
it has 5 weaknesses:
	prototypal inheritance
	equality and type juggling
	management of modules
	scope
	lack of types

TS aims to solve these weaknesses.

to check out stuff in the console:
"node name-of-script.ts" ta da.
getting errors in the console?
"tsc name-of-app.ts" to transpile to js.
"tsc name-of-app.ts --watch" to keep updating.
"node name-of-script.js" ta da.

24 & 25: basic types

GAB, you're getting some sort of compile error when you try to run the scripts at work.
Probably because you're not using the real solution.
Just a dummy you created to code in VS for the intellisense.
NVM, you fixed it by adding a tsconfig.json file to the work project; I guess that did it.
